## Nmap

### Port Scan

We use nmap to discover open ports

```console
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Hammer]
└─$ sudo nmap -sS -p- -T4 10.10.26.13
Starting Nmap 7.95 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-01-21 13:06 EST
Nmap scan report for 10.10.26.13
Host is up (0.092s latency).
Not shown: 65533 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT     STATE SERVICE
22/tcp   open  ssh
1337/tcp open  waste

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 93.68 seconds
```

### Service Scan

Run a service scan using nmap on discovered open ports

```console
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Hammer]

We found an http server running on port 1337 

## Pentesting the webapp

When we connect to the webapp we fare confronted with a login screen

![Login](/assets/img/CTFs/Hammer/index.jpg)

On this login screen we can see a link that say *"Forgot your password?"* that takes us to a page that allows us to reset the password.

![Reset Password](/assets/img/CTFs/Hammer/forgot_password.jpg)

When we enter `test@test.com` we get an error message 

![Invalid](/assets/img/CTFs/Hammer/invalid_email.jpg)

### Brute-forcing directories

When are look the source page we can see that they have a naming convention for their directories

![Source](/assets/img/CTFs/Hammer/index_source.jpg)

When we brute force search for these directories we will want to prepend `hmr_` onto each line in the wordlist

First copy the wordlist we want to use to our current directory

```console
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Hammer]
└─$ cp /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt .
```

Next we will use an `awk` one liner to prepend `hmr_` onto the wordlist 

```console
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Hammer]
└─$ awk '{print "hmr_" $0}' directory-list-2.3-medium.txt > hmr_wordlist.txt
```

Now we can use `gobuster` to search for these these directories 

```console
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Hammer]
└─$ gobuster dir -u 'http://10.10.26.13:1337' -w hmr_wordlist.txt -x php,txt -t 64 --no-error

```

The most interesting of these directories is `hmr_logs` which may contain valuable information.

![hmr_logs](/assets/img/CTFs/Hammer/hmr_logs.jpg)

The only file this directory contains is `error.logs` 

![error.logs](/assets/img/CTFs/Hammer/error_logs.jpg)

When we open the logs we find an email we can use to login to the webapp `tester@hammer.thm`, unfortunately we do not have a password to go along with it

### Exploiting Password Reset

 Now that we have a valid email we can got to `/reset_password.php` and try to exploit the process

![reset password](/assets/img/CTFs/Hammer/reset_password.jpg)

When we enter the `tester@hammer.thm` email are then asked for a 4 digit recovery code

![Recovery Code](/assets/img/CTFs/Hammer/recovery_code.jpg)

However, before we can brute force the recovery code, we can see that it has a rate limit that stops brute force attacks

![rate limit](/assets/img/CTFs/Hammer/rate_limit.jpg)

To bypass this we need to add the `X-Forwarded-For` header, this tricks the server into thinking that a requests come from different IP addresses

![X-Forwarded-For](/assets/img/CTFs/Hammer/x_forwarded.jpg)

We can see when are add the header the `rate-limit-pending` resets, and upon further testing we find that the `X-Forwarded-For` header does not even need to be a valid IP address

![X-Forwarded-For](/assets/img/CTFs/Hammer/x_forwarded_2.jpg)

Now that we can bypass the rate limiting we can brute force the recovery code using `ffuf` 

First we need to generate a wordlist of 4 digit numbers, we can do this using `crunch` 

```console
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Hammer]
└─$ crunch 4 4 -t "%%%%" -o 4digits.txt 
Crunch will now generate the following amount of data: 50000 bytes
0 MB
0 GB
0 TB
0 PB
Crunch will now generate the following number of lines: 10000 

crunch: 100% completed generating output
```

Now we can use this wordlist to brute force the recovery code, 

```console 
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Hammer]
└─$ ffuf -X POST -d "recovery_code=FUZZ&s=180" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -H "X-Forwarded-For: FUZZ" -H "Cookie: PHPSESSID=8g66jsvhbo4r6p794cq0u555vu" -u http://10.10.143.38:1337/reset_password.php -w 4digits.txt -fr "Invalid or expired recovery code\!"

```

Now that we have the valid recovery code we can change the password after we enter it

![New Password](/assets/img/CTFs/Hammer/new_password.jpg)

After we change the password we can now use it to login with `tester@hammer.thm`, and that brings us to `/dashboard.php`, which also contains the first flag

![Dashboard.php](/assets/img/CTFs/Hammer/dashboard.jpg)

### Remote Code Execution

When we submit a command we can see that it sends it in a json format to `/execute_command.php`, we also can see that we have a json web token(JWT) that we send with the request

![JWT](/assets/img/CTFs/Hammer/jwt.jpg)

In addition when we send a command other than `ls` we get `"error": "command not allowed"`

![error](/assets/img/CTFs/Hammer/not_allowed.jpg)

When we look at the JWT via [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/) we can see that the token uses a key ID(kid) and that we have the role `user` , 

![JWT](/assets/img/CTFs/Hammer/jwt_io.jpg)

Fortunately when we run the `ls` command we can see a key file in the directory the web app is running from

![key](/assets/img/CTFs/Hammer/key.jpg)

When can get the key by using `curl` 

```console
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Hammer]
└─$ curl http://10.10.245.71:1337/188ade1.key
56058354efb3daa97ebab00fabd7a7d7 
```

Now that we have a key we can create a new jwt that has the admin role, first we need to point the `kid` to `188ade1.key` then replace the `user` role with `admin` and finally put the key we got in the signature

![Forge JWT](/assets/img/CTFs/Hammer/forge_jwt.jpg)

Using this new token we can replace the old one in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header and when we run `whoami` we now get a response instead of an error

![whoami](/assets/img/CTFs/Hammer/whoami.jpg)

finally we can use `cat` the get the last flag on the machine

![flag](/assets/img/CTFs/Hammer/flag.jpg)
